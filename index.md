## About Me

**Email**: `weiguo@pku.edu.cn`

**WeChat ID**: AlexandreGuo2001

**Github**: [@AlexandreGUO2001](https://github.com/AlexandreGUO2001)

I am now an undergraduate in [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). Previously, I graduated from Zhenhai High School of Zhejiang Province in 2019.

My academic interest lies in the field of **computational statistics**, **deep learning** (especially the generative models) and **theoretical machine learning**.

I am also interested in *la langue fran√ßaise* (the French language), vernaculars of Chinese and minority languages in China ([click here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FCq0Ojw_r7KvD0xMTokveg?pwd=iihk) for a dictionary of Ningbo dialect, Wu Chinese, of which I am a native speaker), [China's railway system](https://www.openrailwaymap.org/), and video games (especially action games such as *Assassin's Creed* and *The Last of Us*).
