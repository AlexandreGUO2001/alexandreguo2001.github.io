**Github**: [@AlexandreGuo2001](https://github.com/AlexandreGUO2001)

I am now an undergraduate in [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn). Previously, I graduated from Zhenhai High School of Zhejiang Province in 2019.

My academic interest lies in the field of **computational statistics**, **machine learning theory** and **deep learning**.

I am also interested in *la langue fran√ßaise* (the French language), vernacular and minority languages in China, the railway system of China, and video games (especially action games such as *Assassin's Creed* and *The Last of Us*).
